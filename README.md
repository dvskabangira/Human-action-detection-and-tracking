# action-detection and tracking
human action detection within a spatial temporal environment

Human Action Detection and Tracking being a crucial area of research in computer vision, involves recognizing and analyzing human activities in video sequences, as well as following individuals across frames.

This technology has been applied in many areas, such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, and sports analytics. 
The technology, however, is far from straightforward, it requires the interpretable comprehension of two types of information, spatial (object appearance and location) and temporal (action ordering over time)
In this project, we used yolo for human detection and deepSORT for tracking puporses.
